# Launch a Unity ratsim build on a headless Linux box.
#
# Two display modes:
#
#   xvfb  Bring up a throwaway X server for this instance and run Unity with
#         -batchmode -nographics. Nothing to set up beforehand and no root
#         needed, so this is the only mode that works on an HPC compute node.
#         Also measured ~2.2x faster than rendering (RCI_CLUSTER_PORT.md §1).
#   gfx   Attach to a pre-existing X server (default :99, from
#         setup_headless_display.sh) and let Unity render normally. Use this if
#         the agent has a camera sensor (RGBD): -nographics gives Unity a null
#         graphics device, so cameras produce nothing.
#
# Mode: --xvfb / --gfx, or RATSIM_XVFB=1 / RATSIM_XVFB=0. Default is auto —
# xvfb when an xvfb binary is on PATH, else gfx.
#
# Usage:
#   ./start_ratsim_headless.sh <bin> [--port 9000] [--log /path/log] [--force]
#   ./start_ratsim_headless.sh --port 9001                    # uses $RATSIM_UNITY_BIN
#
# If <bin> is omitted the env var RATSIM_UNITY_BIN must be set.
# Default port is 9000. Default log is $RATSIM_RUNDIR/ratsim_<port>.log.
# A pidfile holding the *Unity* pid goes to $RATSIM_RUNDIR/ratsim_<port>.pid.
# $RATSIM_RUNDIR defaults to /tmp.
# --force kills the existing instance on this port (if any) before launching.
