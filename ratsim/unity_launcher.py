"""Helpers for launching/discovering Unity ratsim instances.

Supports two operational tiers:

1. **Manual / interactive**: user launches Unity themselves (Editor Play mode
   or `start_ratsim_headless.sh`). Scripts default to port 9000, find the
   running instance, attach. Only works for n_envs=1.
2. **Auto-spawn**: `RATSIM_UNITY_BIN` env var points at the build. Scripts can
   spawn additional instances on demand. n_envs=1 still reuses port 9000 if
   alive (debug-friendly); n_envs>1 always spawns fresh on a separate range
   so it can't clobber the persistent debug instance.

Under SLURM (`$SLURM_JOB_ID` set) the node is shared with other users, so
tier 1 is disabled — port 9000 is never reused, the default port window is
derived from the job id, every port is bind-tested, and pidfiles live in
per-job scratch rather than `/tmp`. None of that applies off SLURM.

The intended usage from a training script::

    from ratsim.unity_launcher import allocate_unity_instances

    instances = allocate_unity_instances(n_envs=8, fresh=False)
    # instances is a list of UnityInstance(port=..., owned=...) — one per env.
    # Owned instances are killed at process exit; reused ones are left alone.

This module never assumes a port is alive just because it answers — callers
that need a heartbeat should send one over TCP after connecting.
